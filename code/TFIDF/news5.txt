Two people were killed and 19 were wounded in a high school shooting in rural Kentucky.

Gov. Matt Bevin tweeted that it happened Tuesday morning at Marshall County High School in Benton, Ky. According to the Kentucky State Police, the campus was secured at 9:11 a.m. and a 15-year-old male suspect was apprehended by a Marshall County sheriff's deputy.

The two who died were a 15-year-old male and 15-year-old female, according to CBS.

The girl died at the scene and the boy died later at a hospital, the governor said. All of the victims were believed to be students, according to The Associated Press. Some were flown about 120 miles to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said Tavia Smith, a spokeswoman for the governor's office.

Nearly 100 children ran out of the school seeking safety, said Mitchell Garland, who rushed outside of his business when he heard about the shooting.

"They was running and crying and screaming," he said. "They was just kids running down the highway. They were trying to get out of there."

Garland said he made sure the students were safe. He said his own son, a 16-year-old sophomore, jumped into someone's car and sped away, then made his way to his dad's office.

"Everyone is just scared. Just terrified for their kids," Garland said. "We're a small town and we know a lot of the kids."

The community is about 120 miles northwest of Nashville.

The shooting came one day after a shooting at Italy High School in Ellis County wounded a 15-year-old girl.
