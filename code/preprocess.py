killing for a long time after they are lost photo sea shepherd uk by mark crowley russell fathoms free a team of volunteer conservationists based in cornwall in the south of england has announced a partnership with the uk branch of global conservation group sea shepherd to tackle the problem of ghost gear in the uk s waters divers from fathoms free have been conducting ghost gear retrieval operations for the last four years with 19 events in 2017 alone ghost gear refers to the vast amount of fishing nets pots and lines that are lost at sea they take centuries to degrade meanwhile continuing to capture live animals including turtles dolphins and sharks along with smaller fish and crustaceans which inevitably die as a result of their entanglement although the actual figures are unknown it is estimated that around 640 000 tons of ghost gear is lost in the ocean every year despite our work having had a highly notable localised benefit to the marine environment the thing that has become apparent during this time is the sheer scale of the problem we face says natallia paliakova project co ordinator and diver for fathoms free with a problem of this magnitude a collaborative approach to remove this threat is essential ffteam 1000 the team from fathoms free after landing their haul of nets photo natallia paliakova fathoms free fathoms free are really excited to announce our latest partnership with the inspiring team at sea shepherd uk on their ghostnet campaign writes paliakova sea shepherd uk has conducted numerous campaigns around the world removing ghost and illegal fishing gear it has been great to meet the team and learn from their experiences during their adventures we hope that our practical experience of ghost gear removal and recycling and extensive expertise on the ghost gear related legislation in the uk will help contribute to their ghostnet campaign in a press release on their website sea shepherd uk ssuk announced that they are launching its ghostnet campaign as a long term operation and will work closely with the marine management organisation mmo and other relevant authorities in england scotland and wales to ensure that ghost fishing equipment is removed safely legally and without harm to the environment or wildlife in addition to the partnership ssuk has recently added a new rhib rigid hull inflatable boat to their fleet with the

of work that goes into planning a ghost gear campaign and the desire to just get stuck in is great keen to make a start we invited the sea shepherd uk team to join us on a ghost gear event in october 2017 prior to them launching their campaign and conducted two retrievals on the wrecks of volnay and stanwood in cornwall the knowledge and enthusiasm of the sea shepherd uk team was contagious the event was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone and we are looking forward to working with this dedicated group of divers and conservationists to advance our mutual goal of making our seas a safer place for wildlife both teams are now working hard behind the scenes surveying planning and putting logistics in place the mmo released a statement in 2017 informing conservation groups that licenses must be purchased for ghost gear removal operations and fathoms free have had such licenses for a number of sites approved by the mmo through consultation with natural england historic england and the ministry of defence more joint operations are alrready on the horizon including a beach clean to be held at gyllyngvase on 17 march as part of the falmouth spring festival further events and news will
